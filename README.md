# This project aims to gain insights into customer behavior and spending patterns through customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. The Mall Customers dataset, which includes customers' age, gender, annual income, and spending score, is utilized for this purpose. The project uses the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.cluster.KMeans, sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler, and sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score. The dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/ArinB/MSBA-CA-Data/raw/main/CA06/Mall_Customers.csv
